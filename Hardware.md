# Install the hardware

## Pre-requisites

1. Comfort II System running firmware 7.xxx or above - 
   The Comfort system should have enough available power to supply the UCM-Pi. Ideally the UCM-Pi should be mounted, connected to and directly powered by a master or slave panel with its own PSU and battery with no other UCM's connected.
   The UCM-Pi may crash or restart if the power supply isn't sufficient.
2. An Ethernet connection to the panel where the UCM-Pi will be mounted
3. CM3 or CM3+ which can be bought from a list of suppliers found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-3-plus/) - A CM3/CM3+ can be bought pre-configured from alphaWerk (contact matt@alphawerk.co.uk for more information). If you have a pre-configured CM3/CM3+ you may skip any steps which involve flashing or configuring the operating system and node-red found in this guide.
4. Access to a USB Keyboard and Monitor or TV with HDMI input to assist with flashing
5. A Windows, Mac or Linux PC


## Setting up the hardware

1. Download a pre-built operating system image with the necessary hardware changes [here](https://uhai.alphawerk.co.uk/scripts/cm_alphawerk.img.zip).

2. Flash the CM3/CM3+ with downloaded image. You can use [this guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/computemodule/cm-emmc-flashing.md) to flashing the Compute Module (CM3/CM3+).
