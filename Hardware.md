# Installing the hardware

## Pre-requisits

1. Comfort II System running firmware 7.xxx or above
...The Comfort system should have enough available power to supply the UCM/Pi. Ideally the UCM/Pi should be mounted connected to and powered by a master or slave panel with its own PSU and battery with no other UCM's connected.
2. 100/1000 Gb Ethernet connection to the panel where the UCM/Pi will be mounted
3. CM3 or CM3+ which can be bought from a list of suppliers found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-3-plus/)
...A CM3/CM3+ may be bought pre-configured from alphawerk, please contact matt.brain@alphawerk.co.uk for more information. If you have a pre-configured CM3/CM3+ you may skip any steps which involve flashing or configuring the operating system and node-red found in this guide

4. Access to a USB Keyboard and Monitor or TV with HDMI input to assist with flashing
5. A Windows, Mac or Linux PC
