Installation instructions for getting started with the UCM/Pi

## What is this all about

This guide is intended to help new users of the UCM/Pi (a Universal Communication Module which supports a Raspberry Pi CM3 compatible single board computer) install the operating system, configure the device, install Node-Red and related code developed by alphaWerk to interface Node-Red to the Cytech Comfort Home Automation and Security System

Note: This guide is still in beta, as is the alphaWerk Node-Red modules and associated code.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need

1. A Cytech Comfort Alarm system (www.cytech.com)  
2. A UCM/Pi available from Cytech
3. A Raspberry Pi CM3 or compatible device with onboard eMMC storage (min 4Gb)
4. A Windows, Mac or Linux computer

This guide below assumes you have performed the following steps:

1.  Flashed your UCM/Pi with the latest version of Raspbian Lite or Raspbian (https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
2.  Have been able to connect the UCM/Pi to your network and Confort system, set a hostname and login.

## Configuring the Operating System

### Enable the serial port 

`sudo raspi-config` from the command line.

1. Select Menu `5 Interfacing Options`
2. Select Menu `P6 Serial`

6. Select Menu `A1 Expand Filesystem`
5. Select `<Finish>` and `<Yes>` if prompted to reboot. 

Log back into the UCM/Pi once it has rebooted.

### Edit /boot/config.txt

`sudo nano /boot/config.txt` from the command line.

add the following to the bottom of the text file.

```
enable_uart=1
dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt
dtparam=uart0=on
```

## Installing Node-Red and alphaWerk components

execute the following command

```
curl -sL https://uhai.alphawerk.co.uk/scripts/quickstart | bash -
```

## All Done

Navigate to http://\<IP Address\>:1080 in a browser to create a user account and start using Node-Red.
