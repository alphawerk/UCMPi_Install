# Add Apple Homekit to Node-Red
Installation instructions for adding Apple HomeKit support to Node-Red on the UCM/Pi

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have completed the [Quick Start](Quick%20Start.md) process and have logged in to a shell either via SSH or using a keyboard and monitor plugged into the UCM/Pi

## Installing Apple HomeKit Support.

Apple HomeKit support is via a [community managed node-red module](https://github.com/NRCHKB/node-red-contrib-homekit-bridged).

To install it, go to the command line and execute the following commands:

```
cd ~/.node-red
npm install NRCHKB/node-red-contrib-homekit-bridged
pm2 restart node red
```
 
If you want to make use of the RTSP streaming capability, you will also need some other optional components as below (taken from [this](https://github.com/KhaosT/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/wiki/Raspberry-PI) excellent note)

At the time of writing, you will also need the development version of the Homekit libraries, substitute `nrchkb/node-red-contrib-homekit-bridged#dev` for `NRCHKB/node-red-contrib-homekit-bridged` above.

Please note, you will need ~ 1.5Gb free to install these components as they need to be compiled. Once installed the source materials are deleted, freeing up much of the working disk space.
